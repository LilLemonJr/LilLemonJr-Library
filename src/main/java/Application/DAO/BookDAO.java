/**
 * A DAO is a class that mediates the transformation of data between the format of objects in Java to rows in a
 * database. The methods here are mostly filled out, you will just need to add a SQL statement.
 *
 * We may assume that the database has already created a table named 'book'.
 * It contains similar values as the Author class:
 * isbn, which is of type int and is a primary key,
 * author_id, which is of type int, and is a foreign key associated with the column 'id' of 'author',
 * name, which is of type varchar(255),
 * copies_available, which is of type int.
